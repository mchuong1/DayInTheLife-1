      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Trang, I'm 27 years old and I'm from Vietnam! I was born in Phu Quoc island, whose beauty should be compared with a paradise I believe, I'm proud to get to say that it is my original hometown, I have been living in Ho Chi Minh city (Saigon city) for almost 9 years now, and with no doubt, I love this city like my second home, it never stops making me feel amazed! I once decided to spend a month to travel around Vietnam when I was 22 since I love traveling! Beside it, I also love making new friends, because when we get to meet and talk to people, the world is naturally brought to us then, through other stories and experiences, I do believe so!</p>

      I am changingchanging
